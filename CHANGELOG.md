## [0.2.2] - 2019-08-19

Patch release.

* Fix closing connections which are not `listen`ing to `input` (solved #60),
* Add more clear example of detecting which side caused disconnection,
* Add exception on `add`ing to `output` if connection closed,
* `BluetoothConnection` `cancel` is deprecated now, use `close` instead. It was stupid to name `cancel` something that `close`s (it was even documented that way, lol).
